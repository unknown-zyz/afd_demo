| Prefill / TTFT-path | 3730.107 ms | - |
| Decode loop total | - | - |
| Decode steps | - | - |
| Decode TPOT | - | - |
| Legacy decode step (not exact TPOT) | 240.967 ms | - |
| Compute | - | - |
| Recv wait | - | - |
| MoE router | - | - |
| MoE experts | - | - |
| MoE shared/dense | - | - |
| Compute ratio | - | - |
| Tokens/sec | 2.34 | - |

- `Model-side generation total` is `total_time_ms` for the full generation call.
- The Attention/FFN columns are rank-level wall-clock views of the same serial run; they are not per-role compute decomposition.
- `Decode TPOT` is the serial decode baseline used for decode speedup.
- Missing serial display fields were filled from the matching serial cache JSON.
- `Legacy decode step` is shown for audit only; it is not exact TPOT and is not used for speedup.
